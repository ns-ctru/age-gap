A brief summary of follow-up data is provided.  At present the only data available on deaths is catpured in the *Study completion / discontinuation form* Case Report Form (CRF) which does not exclusively record deaths but also patients desire to withdraw.  Such instances result in [right-censoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis#Censoring) as it prevents the researcher from observing the participant for the intended follow-up period.

```{r results_cohort_survival_summary, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = 'hide', cache = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
## Tabulate the causes of death by the primary treatments
age_gap %>%
    dplyr::filter(event_name == 'Baseline') %$%
    table(disc_rsn, primary_treatment, useNA = 'ifany')

## Plot bar-chart (with scattered dots) of the age at death
age_gap %>%
    dplyr::filter(event_name == 'Baseline') %>%
    ggplot(aes(primary_treatment, age_last_seen, fill = primary_treatment)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    ylab('Age at Last Contact (Years)') +
    xlab('Primary Treatment Group') +
    theme(legend.position = 'none')

## Plot bar-chart of survival from study recruitment/diagnosis)
age_gap %>%
    dplyr::filter(event_name == 'Baseline') %>%
##    dplyr::mutate()
    ggplot(aes(primary_treatment, survival, fill = primary_treatment)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    ylab('Survival (Days)') +
    xlab(' APrimary Treatment Group') +
    theme(legend.position = 'none')
