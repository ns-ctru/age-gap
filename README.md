# Bridging the Age Gap in Breast Cancer: Improving outcomes for older women

This project contains an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for analysing and reporting the results of the Randomised Control Trial (RCT) component of the [Bridging The Age Gap Study](https://www.shu.ac.uk/research/specialisms/centre-for-health-and-social-care-research/what-we-do/our-expertise/health-care-and-service-delivery-research/case-studies/bridging-the-age-gap-in-breast-cancer-research-improving-outcomes-for-older-women) which seeks to improve outcomes for older women who have breast cancer.

## Analyses

Detailed Statistical Analysis Plans are provided under `~/doc/sap` although it should be noted that this work focuses only on the Cohort component.  All work is conducted in-line with the principles of [reproducible research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research) such that the files within this project allow the replication of the Statistical Report.  Work is version controlled (using [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/)) and hosted here on [Github](https://github.com/about/) to demonstrate the openness of the statistician to sharing work and critique.

### Software

All analyses are performed using the statistical programming language [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and a number of additional packages from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/) (details of which can be found in the `~/lib/DESCRIPTION` file for the project specific R package).
