### Survival

### Follow-up

As survival at full five-year follow-up is not currently available the `Study Completion and Discontinuation Form` is being used as a proxy for the time being.  This is, unless a participant withdraws early, meant to be completed at two year follow-up, although this is only true for a fraction of cases as shown in the figure below.  Those who are still being followed up are purposefully included in this table, the distribution reveals how "close" to the stated follow-up date individuals are seen.  Data at baseline correspond to the last data of contact for that person.

```{r results-study-completion, echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8,eval = TRUE}
## Plot the reasons for study completion/discontinuation
age_gap %>%
    ## Either replace disc_rsn with text indicating no completion data...
    mutate(`Last Contact Type` = ifelse(!is.na(disc_rsn),
                                        yes = as.character(disc_rsn),
                                        no  = "No Completion, date last seen.")) %>%
    ## ...or remove those individuals who don't have it.
    ## dplyr::filter(!is.na(disc_rsn)) %>%
##ggplot(, aes(as.numeric(survival), colour = disc_rsn)) +
    ggplot(aes(as.numeric(survival),
               colour = `Last Contact Type`,
               fill   = `Last Contact Type`)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 80, position = "stack") +
    ## annotate("432",
    ##          x = 0, y = 432) +
    xlab("Days") +
    ylab("N") +
    ggtitle("Survival by Event Date") +
    ## facet_wrap(~event_name, ncol = 1) +
    facet_grid(event_name~`Last Contact Type`, scales = "free") +
    ## ToDo - Sort out legend title
    ## scale_fill_colour(name = "Last Contact Type") +
    ## theme(legend.text = "Last Contact") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.position = "none")
