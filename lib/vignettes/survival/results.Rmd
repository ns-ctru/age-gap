### Primary Treatment Classification


### Death Follow-up

As full five-year follow-up is not currently available the `Study Completion and Discontinuation Form` is being used as a proxy for the time being.  This is, unless a participant withdraws early, meant to be completed at two year follow-up, although this is only true for a fraction of cases as shown in the figure below.

```{r results-study-completion, echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8,eval = TRUE}
## Plot the reasons for study completion/discontinuation
age_gap %>%
    ## Either replace disc_rsn with text indicating no completion data...
    mutate(`Last Contact Type` = ifelse(!is.na(disc_rsn),
                                        yes = as.character(disc_rsn),
                                        no  = "No Completion, date last seen.")) %>%
    ## ...or remove those individuals who don't have it.
    ## dplyr::filter(!is.na(disc_rsn)) %>%
##ggplot(, aes(as.numeric(survival), colour = disc_rsn)) +
    ggplot(aes(as.numeric(survival),
               colour = `Last Contact Type`,
               fill   = `Last Contact Type`)) +
